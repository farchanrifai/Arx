description: This week was a mix of work chaos, unexpected stress, and some much-needed downtime. But even with all that, a meaningful day off and exciting things ahead remind me that there’s always a silver lining.

This week has been kind of interesting for me—read: not great. I spent my weekend working, which I usually enjoy, but not this time. On top of that, my mental state wasn’t in the best place due to the never-ending drama happening around me.

## **5 Work Days + 2 Work End**

Last week was the first week of August, and as usual, it was a whirlwind. The first week of the month always seems to be a chaotic mess, and this time was no different. If you’re like me, your work tasks are often rely on others' work, organizing all the scattered information across the company can be a real pain.

The lack of consistency in storing and communicating information drives me up the wall. We spent days just gathering the necessary details, and it felt like such a waste of time. And don’t even get me started on the missing pieces or poorly communicated info—talk about adding fuel to the fire!

This kind of chaos is a monthly ritual. Sometimes it’s a bit more manageable, but often it just gets messier. Working on the weekend could have been a breeze if everything was ready, but this time, it definitely wasn’t.

## **Mental breakdance**

I guess life really is full of drama. It's rare for things happening around me to actually bother me, let alone stress me out. But what’s been happening in these early days of August is different. I was all set to welcome new friends onto my team, but then I found out something big—heartbreaking, mind-blowing, anger-inducing going on behind the scenes. I can’t get into details since, well, they might read this 👀. In short, I was furious and never thought something like this would happen to me here.

For a few nights I’ve been lying awake in my tiny 4x6 room, staring at the ceiling, thinking, "So... what now?" If you believe in the "five stages of grief" theory, I’m somewhere between anger and depression—and it sucks. You can’t really enjoy your day, you can’t think straight, and if you have no one to talk to, it’s a living hell. But on the bright side, I might be getting a new experience out of this: talking to a psychologist.

## **Google is a monopolist! And Kominfo is 💩**

I called myself a tech enthusiast just because I’m really into consumer tech products and try to stay updated with it—well, when work doesn’t take over. Lately, there’s been big news about Google being labeled a monopoly. A judge ruled that Google’s been pulling some shady moves to keep its spot as the default search engine. They’ve been paying companies like Apple and Samsung a ton of money just to make sure Google is the default option on their devices. Now, the US Justice Department and state attorneys are discussing how to handle this. The outcome could mean breaking up Google or forcing them to change how they do business to level the playing field. It’s actually a huge deal.

I’ve been trying to dodge Google’s products where I can, mostly because of privacy concerns. But can I ditch Google Search entirely? Sort of. I’ve been using DuckDuckGo for my searches. It’s not as powerful as Google, but it does the job. For the past few months, I’ve been switching back and forth between Google Search and DuckDuckGo. But now, I’m stuck with Google again because, surprise surprise, our lovely Kominfo decided to block DuckDuckGo in Indonesia. Is anyone even shocked anymore when you hear “Kominfo”, “blocked”, and a popular site name in the same sentence? They’ve been on a spree, blocking popular sites for no good reason. Remember when they blocked PayPal and Steam in 2022? Like, “WTF?” People rely on those every day! Now they’re going after DuckDuckGo, which a lot of us use too. As far as I know, DuckDuckGo has better privacy policies than Google—maybe that’s what our government doesn’t like?

## **A meaningful day off**

This week has been hell, but I survived. After taking hit after hit, I decided to take a day off—not just from work, but from the office life 🙄. I spent the day with my wife, enjoying good food, watching movies, and venting about our crappy days. Turns out, I’m not the only one having a rough start to August.

## **Wrap-up takeaways**

This week was a mix of tough lessons and small victories. Whether it’s handling work chaos, navigating unexpected personal stress, or just dealing with Kominfo's latest flop, these experiences remind me that life is rarely smooth sailing. But taking time to recharge, connecting with people who matter, and staying open to new possibilities can make even the rough weeks more manageable. Growth isn’t always easy, but every challenge is a chance to get better at balancing it all.

## **What's next:**

- August 18th will mark the 9th anniversary of when I started dating the girl who is now my wife. Can’t wait to celebrate and have a good day!
- A friend is joining my team; can’t wait to take a step sideways.
- Apparently, an update to my career?.
